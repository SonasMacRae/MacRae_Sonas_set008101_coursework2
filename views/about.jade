      p Well at the time of writing this I'm 19 years old and studying Computing Science in Edinburgh, Scotland. I wouldn't say I'm an interesting person so writing this 'about the author' page is going to be difficult, I'll give it a try though. I could use a lipsum generator, that would be quicker... although having and writing about myself is probably healthy, therefore here I am writing, and you happen to be reading this, so.. Thanks, I guess? I should probably start with my hobbies, my main hobby is playing video games, if I didn't have to spend my time studying I would spend my life playing video games. Its been that way as long as I can remember, by the age of 5 I was playing Halo. Thats where the addiction started, I don't regret spending thousands of hours being absorbed in these virtual worlds, I've made many friends from online play throughout the years. I did have friends in real life too, but they all played video games so there was no escaping the insane fun to be had blowing random people up online and listening to them get upset and call you lots of nasty things. Such nasty things won't be repeated on this blog site. In the gaming universe, there are millions of players who dedicate themselves to the games they play to reach the highest ranks on online play, the higher rank you are they better player you are. Despite the thousands of hours I've invested into these games (hours I should of used to study and meet real people), there is only one game where I have achieved a high rank: Fifa, yes I play Fifa, a new edition of Fifa is released each year and everyone has to start climbing from the lowest rank. So achieving the highest rank in Fifa doesn't mean anything when the next new Fifa is released (which is the same game with updated kits and club rosters), I have reached the highest rank in Fifa each year since 2012, infact I'm about to hit this rank for a second time on another account. To sum this up, I am a football addict... But it gets worse, I haven't actually played football since I left my home town 2 years ago. I'm sure I'm boring you with football talk, I do have other interests. I also like music. Love music infact, can't go a day without listening to music, music is a miracle. I like hip-hop, even though I don't give off that vibe. At this point I'm just writing what comes to mind, I'm taller than average, I like maths, science and engineering. I come from the Highlands of Scotland, yeah that's something interesting to talk about, I was born and raised in the Highlands. Its beautiful up there, I grew up in a village called Ullapool in the far north-west, it was quiet for most of the year, being a tourist hot-spot in the summer the place is packed. Its cold, it rains for 90% of the year and the internet speeds are frustraitingly slow. I mean you should be able to stream Netflix and play Playstation online simultaniously. The clostest city was over an hour away, but we had shops so we didn't starve. On the other hand, I was in very good shape growing up, I would run, cycle, swim and play sports a lot, since thats nearly all there is to do in No-where-ville. I had two brothers to play with, one older and one younger, although the three of us have different interests and hobbies we do all have an interest in technology and gaming. Ok I'll get more to the point, here are some quick fire facts: My favourite meal is a curry, my favourite colour is green, although it was blue when I was younger, my middle name is Duncan, I'm not a strong swimmer, despite studying computing, I'm terrible with computers. I hope this is enough information for you, the reader. I'm going to go back to finishing off the rest of this website, yaay!
